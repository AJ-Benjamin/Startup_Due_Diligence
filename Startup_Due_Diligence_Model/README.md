# Startup-Due-Diligence-Model_with_Gradio

I created an AI model that supercharge due diligence for customers, investors or recruits by analyzing the contents of any company's website landing page and creates a short brochure about the company.

The first frontier model I designed is a helpful assistant powered by the OpenAI  gpt-4o-mini. With interactive textbox to receive user input message and a clear and submit button to erase or let her get to work. 

I redesigned the frontier model but powered by Anthropic claude-3-haiku-2022… model.

But, what about a model but you get to choose who runs it, OpenAI or Claude? And I created it

Finally, to create a likely to-be-used model, I created a model that
analyzes the contents of a company website landing page and creates a short brochure about the company for prospective customers, investors and recruits. 

This was achieved through web scrapping by using @beautiful soup and slapping in our frontier model with Gradio UI which have a GPT/Claude download to select who analyze the content of the website.
